ros-hydro-sdformat (1.4.6-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Simulate 1.4.6 version
  * First changelog needed to run bloom
  * New package.xml to be used with bloom
  * Add Console_TEST
  * Update end tags
  * remove dead code
  * Add an ostream-like class with a << operator that can print to a console and a
    file.  All messages go to ~/.sdformat/sdformat.log.  Error, Warning, and Msg
    messages additionally go to stderr.
    Two inelegant aspects of this implementation:
    1. The control characters that colorize the console output also go to the log
    file, making it slightly less readable.
    2. The Console::ConsoleStream class does not fully implement the ostream spec;
    e.g., you can't pass std::endl to it.
    With the new logging system in place, I made two changes to what is logged, at
    what level:
    1. On the assumption that they were commented out to avoid console spam,
    I uncommented all the working sdfdbg invocations in parser_urdf.cc.
    2. Demoted two common messages in parser_urdf.cc from sdfwarn to sdfdbg.
  * change default friciton for bullet from -1 to 1 as well.  Remove max value constraints for friction parameters.
  * change default mu and mu2 from max float to 1 (max physical value in each frictional direction).
  * merging some updates from simbody branch
  * Added units to sensitivity
  * Typo in sensivity changed to sensitivity
  * Merged with default
  * Added receiver frequency range and sensivity for a wireless receiver
  * change visual_blobs array to shared_ptr (didn't show up in tests)
  * use shared_ptr to fix memory leaks, issue #13
  * remove old pkgconfig and cmake config files, issue #14
  * Merged from sdf_1.4
  * clearing extensions from previous models for every new model. closes #16
  * New transceiver sdf for wireless sensors
  * Add attribute to <joint><axis> to specify which frame to use. Related to gazebo issue 494
  * Add comment about -s option on osx
  * Fix tests, warnings, and code_check on osx
  * Merged in sdf_1.4 (pull request #28)
    Merge sdf_1.4 back to default
  * Added audio tags
  * Add sdf definitions for gps sensor, sensor noise, and world spherical coordinates, correponding to gazebo branch gps_sensor
  * Added tag sdformat_1.4.5 for changeset 52862f6b1db3
  * bump to 1.4.5
  * Fix backward compatibility
  * Fix trailing whitespace
  * Added tag sdformat_1.4.4 for changeset 5324b6148ee7
  * bump to 1.4.4
  * removed redundant commit. better adherence to gazebo style guide.
  * patch to allow parser_urdf to parse visual plugins
  * Support to categorize test with prefixes
    It will allow to run UNIT or PERFORMANCE in separate runs
  * Merged in sdf_1.4 (pull request #22)
    Merge from 1.4 to default
  * Merged in test_urdf (pull request #18)
    Add Jose's parser tests, originally in gazebo pr 608
  * change arg to reference, per code_check
  * add missing link dir
  * Merged in sdformat_rename (pull request #17)
    Rename top-level files/directories from sdf to sdformat
  * Merged in issue_10 (pull request #20)
    rename SDF.hh to SDFImpl.hh (issue #10)
  * update ifdef guard name
  * implement logging, #8
  * rename SDF.hh to SDFImpl.hh (issue #10)
  * restore old equality operator tolerance
  * Add Jose's parser tests, originally in gazebo pr 608
  * Rename top-level files/directories from sdf to sdformat, to avoid conflict with
    existing sdf package.  Issues #5 and #6.
  * Added tag sdformat_1.4.3 for changeset 82cb49c98252
  * bump to 1.4.3
  * Merged in erp_cfm_visual_lump (pull request #12)
    fix baxter parsing, lumped visual element pasing and stop erp/cfm parsing
  * remove unused variable
  * Fix for qt bug 22829
  * Fix unneeded if
  * revert test code
  * if we are skipping links, user should know about it.  it makes debugging much easier.  making these sdfmsg makes it hard to redirect gzsdf print results to a file directly.
  * fix equal comparison so tolerance is 1e-6, matches gazebo.  inspired by the bug that cuts off baxter arms during parsing because arm_mount mass is 0.00094542.
  * fix stop erp and cfm parsing and visual element reduced naming (misisng _)
  * restore old name for URDF collision bodies to fix https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/758
  * fix vector3 parsing for branch sdf_1.4
  * Fixed parsing of Vector3 from strings in URDF parser
  * Added tag sdformat_1.4.2 for changeset 00f1269dbae8
  * bump to 1.4.2
  * Only insert robot origin pose if it was successfully parsed from the URDF
  * Add missing line from old URDF parser to insert the uri element for meshes
  * Fix a search/replace error for parsing gazebo extensions
  * Check for empty callback to avoid crashing on improper usage.
  * Don't tell findFile() to use the callback because one hasn't been registered.
